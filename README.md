# Questions-on-Writing

What are my writing habits?

In general I would say that my writing habits lean more on the side of playful.
I like to ask questions in my documents such as "So what odes this mean" or 'Where do we go from here?" 
These questions are not neccesary; however, it is difficult for me to avoid using them. 
This can be improved by paying very close attention to when I am wanting to add in a question and rather choosing to add something more professional. 

Another habit that I tend to have when writing is that I struggle with just writing a basic draft.
I tend to try and revise constantly as I go, rahter than moving on and getting the overall document done before I revise. 
This can put me back hours and have nothing but a few sentences to show for it. 
I can improve this by continuing to write. I would have to constantly make an effort to avoid using the back button and press forward. 
As difficult as this sounds, I think I would really see improvement in my work. 

One strength that I think I have when writing is organization. My papers tend to be very structured instead of a mess of ideas all thrown into a singe paragraph. This I believe helps me often even when I am not very confident in what I am writing.
